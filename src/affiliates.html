Uppala is the one of the fastest growing urban settlements along the National Highway 66. It is well known as a trade hub in the district, which being prime reason for setting up of our retail outlet at Uppala. Uppala is a major infrastructural hub in the district and is noted for jewellery shops, fast food restaurants and high residential flats which lie across the town. High rises can be seen in town. It is the major destination for retail shopping in the district. Many projects are active in the town. It is a major business hub in the district and also contributed for the rise in remittance in the state, in the most prevalent sectors like real estate, infrastructure, financial institutions, hospitality and healthcare. Uppala is also home to many national level builders, but the town lacks the basic infrastructure like four laned road, proper two laned road connectivity with neighbouring places, footpaths, a better railway station or municipality status due to lack of educated government leaders.</p>
